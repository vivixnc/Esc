<h2>Escape</h2>
<p>
  Escape is a 20 level game, coded in Java, that I created for my APCS class. The motive of the game is to pass all 20 levels consecutively without failure; 
  the levels get more difficult as you progress. Each level consists of a different set of enemies, each enemy type having a different movement pattern. The goal 
  is to get to the portal without touching any of the enemies. It's a very simple concept, but the enemies start going sicko mode towards the end.
